the files of 2001 get merged into 2001.csv using merging.ipynb

# Database Connection and project importation

It's better to use this configuration below because my database configuration was like this, to import the project and to run jobs easy.
    user : root
    password : root
make sure to run the file (./Data Integration and ETL/Disability Warehouse Creation Script.sql) to create the data warehouse


when you import the project in Tatend Studio run job that has name "all_jobs.job" , Weâ€™ve created this global job to help us organize the sequence of execution of our elementary jobs.
